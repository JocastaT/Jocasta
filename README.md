# Hello, folks! 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

My name is Jocasta Tan and I'm a student studying Computer Science. I'm from Singapore, and currently studying in Temasek Polytechnic.
I'm a student who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Ionic Framework, Angular, and MySQL Database. 

## &#x270d; Passion & Goal in Studying Computer Science

As I slowly learn more into Computer Science and learn about the different frameworks and databases, I would hope to join the Software Developer workforce to create more websites and applications. One day, I wish to create my very own application and share it across the world! :)
